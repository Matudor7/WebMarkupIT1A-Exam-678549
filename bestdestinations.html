                    If you’re an adventure seeker looking for a different experience, 
                    South Africa is the perfect holiday destination for you. 
                    It’s a county that offers a wide range of activities, 
                    such as shark cage diving, paragliding off of a mountain, cave exploring, ostrich riding, bungee jumping, 
                    or even riding on the world’s fastest zip slide in Sun City at 75 mph. With the great outdoors scenery, amazing climate, 
                    and so many adrenaline activities to indulge in, one can never feel bored in South Africa. Hence, it’s no wonder you’ll 
                    often time hear people referring to South Africa as the adventure capital of the world.

                <p id="paragraph2" class="paragraphs">
                    Although not a sizeable country by area, Switzerland is huge in terms of diversity. 
                    Situated between Germany, France, Austria and Italy makes for some pretty different 
                    cultural activity no matter where you decide to unpack. If you’re looking for Italian 
                    flair, venture to the southernmost canton of Switzerland, the Ticino. Ticino is a 
                    “land of culture,” with plenty of things to do—from both Swiss and Italian food, to 
                    music and art performances around every corner. It’s also a great region for cycling—from 
                    the stunning mountainous scenery and sparkling lakes to the red-roofed village houses clustered along the shores.

                    Lisbon, with its steep hills, yellow trams and blue-and-white tiles, is a vibrant treat for the eyes. 
                    The wine country to the north is lush and serene. The coastlines are rugged and dramatic. Porto brims 
                    with soulful old-world charm. Outside the cities are expansive olive orchards, farms and national parks 
                    ideal for hiking. Portugal contains a mix of terrains that offer panoramic vistas and accommodate myriad 
                    activities and excursions. Plus, thanks to its location on the southeastern edge of Europe, temperatures 
                    rarely drop much below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and the days are reliably sunny. Lisbon, in fact, has been 
                    named one of the top five sunniest cities on the continent.

                <p id="paragraph4" class="paragraphs">
                    South Korea has a long history dating back over a thousand years. Due to the natural isolation of the Korean 
                    Peninsula, the country’s culture hasn’t changed as much as in other regions. Still today, you can stand in awe 
                    of some of the most significant cultural heritage sites of the country, such as Gyeongbokgung Palace, the main 
                    palace situated in Seoul. The city of Gyeongju is also a place of historic value and is often called a ‘museum 
                    without walls’. Gyeongju was the capital of Korea during the Silla Dynasty from 57 BC – 935 AD and is home to 
                    countless royal tombs, palaces, and temples that are listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites.

                <p id="paragraph5" class="paragraphs">
                    The Dutch craft beer scene is currently booming and new breweries are continuously popping up across the country. 
                    Many of these independent breweries rely on time-honed methods to craft their wares and produce delicious, traditional 
                    Dutch beers with a modern edge. Their numbers include Brouwerij ‘t IJ, which is located underneath a colossal windmill 
                    in Amsterdam, and Jopen in Haarlem, who have converted an old church into their main plant, amongst many others.

                <p id="paragraph6" class="paragraphs">
                    Denmark has a long list of museums and art galleries that cover various art movements and eras. From the Danish Golden Age 
                    and contemporary art to Vikings’ society and sailors’ lives, culture buffs certainly have much to add to their to-see list 
                    before visiting the coolest country in Scandinavia. Even though Copenhagen’s and Aarhus’ culture scene stand out, visitors 
                    will find museums or art galleries that display unique masterpieces in many Danish cities. They may not be as impressive as 
                    The National Gallery of Denmark or ARoS Aarhus Art Museum, but they will certainly captivate your interest.
